<br>
This project analyze accident dataset to explore how factors like age,gender,speed,helmet and seatbelt usage affect survivle rates
<br>
🚦 Accident Analysis Project:
<br>
📌 Introduction:
<br>
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to identify major causes, trends, and patterns.
<br>
The purpose is to understand which factors (e.g., weather, time, vehicle type, location) contribute most to accidents and how preventive measures can be designed.
<br>
📊 Dataset:
<br>
Source: [ Kaggle]
<br>
🛠 Tools & Libraries:
<br>
The project is developed using Python and the following libraries:
<br>
.pandas
.numpy
.matplotlib
.seaborn
<br>
📈 Analysis Performed:
<br>
.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
<br>
.Missing values handling
<br>
.Feature distribution
<br>
.Accident trends by year, month, day, time
<br>
.ocation-based accident mapping
<br>
.Visualizations
<br>
.Heatmaps
<br>
.Trend lines
<br>
.Statistical Tests:
<br>
.Chi-Square Test (relationship between accident severity & weather)
<br>
.t-Test (difference in casualties between urban and rural areas)
<br>
.ANOVA (comparison of mean accidents across different road types)
<br>
🔑 Key Findings:
<br>
.Most accidents occur during peak traffic hours (7–9 AM & 5–8 PM)
<br>
.Weather conditions like fog and rain significantly increase accident severity
<br>
.Urban areas show higher frequency but rural accidents tend to be more severe
<br>
.Urban areas show higher frequency but rural accidents tend to be more severe
<br>
.Overspeeding & poor visibility are major contributors
<br>
✅ Future Scope:
<br>
.Apply Machine Learning models to predict accident severity
<br>
.Build an interactive dashboard (using Streamlit / PowerBI)
<br>
.Suggest preventive policies for traffic management
