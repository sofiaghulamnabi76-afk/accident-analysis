# accident-analysis
This project analyze accident dataset to explore how factors like age,gender,speed,helmet and seatbelt usage affect survivle rates
ðŸš¦ Accident Analysis Project
ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to identify major causes, trends, and patterns.
The purpose is to understand which factors (e.g., weather, time, vehicle type, location) contribute most to accidents and how preventive measures can be designed.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
Source: [ Kaggle]
ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
The project is developed using Python and the following libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn
ðŸ“ˆ Analysis Performed
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Missing values handling

Feature distribution

Accident trends by year, month, day, time
ocation-based accident mapping

Visualizations

Heatmaps

Bar plots & Pie charts

Trend lines

Statistical Tests

Chi-Square Test (relationship between accident severity & weather)

t-Test (difference in casualties between urban and rural areas)

ANOVA (comparison of mean accidents across different road types)

ðŸ”‘ Key Findings
Most accidents occur during peak traffic hours (7â€“9 AM & 5â€“8 PM)

Weather conditions like fog and rain significantly increase accident severity

Urban areas show higher frequency but rural accidents tend to be more severe
Urban areas show higher frequency but rural accidents tend to be more severe

Overspeeding & poor visibility are major contributors

âœ… Future Scope
Apply Machine Learning models to predict accident severity

Build an interactive dashboard (using Streamlit / PowerBI)

Suggest preventive policies for traffic management
