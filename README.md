# accident-analysis
<br>
This project analyze accident dataset to explore how factors like age,gender,speed,helmet and seatbelt usage affect survivle rates
<br>
ðŸš¦ Accident Analysis Project:
<br>
ðŸ“Œ Introduction:
<br>
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to identify major causes, trends, and patterns.
<br>
The purpose is to understand which factors (e.g., weather, time, vehicle type, location) contribute most to accidents and how preventive measures can be designed.
<br>
ðŸ“Š Dataset:
<br>
Source: [ Kaggle]
<br>
ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries:
<br>
The project is developed using Python and the following libraries:
<br>
.pandas
.numpy
.matplotlib
.seaborn
<br>
ðŸ“ˆ Analysis Performed:
<br>
.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
.Missing values handling
.Feature distribution
.Accident trends by year, month, day, time
.ocation-based accident mapping
.Visualizations
.Heatmaps
.Bar plots & Pie charts
.Trend lines
.Statistical Tests
.Chi-Square Test (relationship between accident severity & weather)
.t-Test (difference in casualties between urban and rural areas)
.ANOVA (comparison of mean accidents across different road types)
<br>
ðŸ”‘ Key Findings:
.Most accidents occur during peak traffic hours (7â€“9 AM & 5â€“8 PM)
.Weather conditions like fog and rain significantly increase accident severity
.Urban areas show higher frequency but rural accidents tend to be more severe
.Urban areas show higher frequency but rural accidents tend to be more severe
.Overspeeding & poor visibility are major contributors
âœ… Future Scope:
.Apply Machine Learning models to predict accident severity
.Build an interactive dashboard (using Streamlit / PowerBI)
.Suggest preventive policies for traffic management
